# Cellular automaton "species" decision-making evolution
This project is a purely experimental crosbreed between such concepts as artificial neural networks, evolutionary algorithms and cellular automatons.
The aim of the project is to create a cellular automaton that resembles Conway's game of life, except it has complex orderly behavioral patterns.
